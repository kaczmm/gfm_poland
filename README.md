	-changed map colour to be darker/paler like Poland, with PLC's shade of pink<br>
<br>
*/gfx/pictures/decisions/*<br>
* tweaked PLC and PLR decisions so all cores are carried over<br>
	(In GFM, PLC and PLR get all cores from their former, but then lose some cores. I disagree with this.)<br>
<br>
*/events/*<br>
	-new event chain for Poland if it is winning the November Uprising by 4% or greater<br>
		-Republic path: Poland gets lots of prestige but Prussia and Austria will declare war<br>
		-Regency path: plurality boost, later get event for Prince Radziwiłł to become king<br>
		-Monarchy path: Prince Czartoryski becomes king (lose plurality but gain "Great Statesman" modifier)<br>
	-Regency and Monarchy paths get an event to negotiate peace with Russia if they are still winning<br>
<br>
