	-changed map colour to be darker/paler like Poland, with PLC's shade of pink
	
/gfx/pictures/decisions/*
	-tweaked PLC and PLR decisions so all cores are carried over
	(In GFM, PLC and PLR get all cores from their former, but then lose some cores. I disagree with this.)
	
/events/*
	-new event chain for Poland if it is winning the November Uprising by 4% or greater
		-Republic path: Poland gets lots of prestige but Prussia and Austria will declare war
		-Regency path: plurality boost, later get event for Prince Radziwiłł to become king
		-Monarchy path: Prince Czartoryski becomes king (lose plurality but gain "Great Statesman" modifier)
	-Regency and Monarchy paths get an event to negotiate peace with Russia if they are still winning

	-PLC/PLC_republic: matching reds
	-PLC_communist: red banner (PRL shade) with white PPS splinter group logo WRN

/localisation/gfm_poland.csv
