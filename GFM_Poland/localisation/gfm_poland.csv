EVTDESC1118001;\n\nShocking the world, we have managed to hold off the Russian army longer than anyone expected. However, everyone knows this state of affairs cannot continue forever. We need to negotiate peace sooner rather than later, and to do that, we need to know who is in charge. After the Sejm voted to dethrone Tsar Nicholas I, Poland has been in a state of limbo. According to the constitution, the current state of affairs is impossible. What should we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1118002;\n\nThe November Uprising across the border in the Russian Kingdom of Poland has spiralled out of control. Russia has proven itself unable or incapable of restoring order, and a free Poland threatens to ignite revolt in our own territories. What should we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1118003;\n\nPoland is still holding its own against Russia, but it might be a good idea to negotiate an amicable peace. We are a landlocked country surrounded by three unfriendly empires, so we will need to scale back our demands or find an ally further afield.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1118004;\n\nWhen the Sejm voted in 1831 to dethrone Tsar Nicholas I, the country entered a state of flux. The Regency Council, which was established to fulfill the constitutional role of king, has become a lame duck. If Poland is to rebuild itself, the regency must end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1118005;\n\nDespite the relative success of their little uprising, it seems the Poles have come crawling back. They have sent us a preliminary peace plan which, if we accept, will return Poland to us as it was in October 1831. The Tsar will be restored to the Polish throne, and a general amnesty will allow them to avoid punishment in Russia. Of course, we could always say no, and remove their autonomy altogether.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1118006;\n\nDespite the relative success of their little uprising, it seems the Poles have heard the voice of reason. They have sent us a preliminary peace plan which, if we accept, will technically grand Poland independence, but tie them to us diplomatically. While not the outcome we were hoping for, it would allow us a graceful exit to this quagmire of a war. Of course, we could always say no, and remove their autonomy altogether.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1118007;\n\nRussia has refused our offer of peace. Only blood will end this war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1118008;\n\nRussia has accepted our offer to return to status quo ante bellum. The Sejm will soon reconvene to reverse Tsar Nicholas I's dethronement, and Poland will return to its personal union under Russia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1118009;\n\nRussia has accepted our offer of peace. Poland will remain an independent state, with its diplomatic affairs controlled by Russia... on paper, at least.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
